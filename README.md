# Statistical-analysis-of-the-risk-factors-of-chronic-respiratory-diseases

The Statistical analysis of the risk factors of chronic respiratory diseases is a group project using R made within the framework of the Business Statistics II class at the University of Neuchâtel:

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as it follows:
- Data
  - Air Quality Data: PM2.5 concentrations (renamed pm25), were sourced from IQAir’s ”World’s Most Polluted Countries” dataset. This variable serves as an indicator of air pollution, with higher values indicating worse air quality.([IQAir (2023)](https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-countries?srsltid=AfmBOopLcWmQQmjRHN_d5HNfaRxPrz9lgCC33AK2QYNpyEQknvij3hy1))
  - Chronic Respiratory Diseases Death Rate (renamed crd): This variable represents death rates due to CDR, sourced from Our World in Data. (https://www.who.int/health-topics/chronic-respiratory-diseases#tab=tab_1)
  - Smoking Rate (renamed smoking): This dataset represents the percentage of adults who smoke, and was also obtained from Our World in Data. ([Our World in Data (2015)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-adults-who-smoke?tab=table&time=earliest..2019&country=USA%7EBRA%7ERUS%7EIND%7ECHN%7EEuropean+Union%7EIDN%7EOWID_WRL)) 

- R Script
  - The script we wrote that allowed us to do our analysis

- Analysis
  - We wrote a report to answer, using the data analysis done in the R script, the problematic we set, which is knowing the impact of smoking and air quality on chronic respiratory diseases
